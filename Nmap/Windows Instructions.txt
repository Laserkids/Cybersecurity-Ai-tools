I see the issue! During my updates, the `check_nmap_installed()` function got lost. Let me fix the entire script:Perfect! I've fixed the error. The problem was that the `check_nmap_installed()` function got accidentally removed during my updates. 

The script is now complete and should work properly. Try running it again:

```bash
python "nmap_scanner (1).py"
```

All functions are now properly defined and the script should run without any errors. It will:
1. ✅ Validate your IP address
2. ✅ Run the nmap scan
3. ✅ Show detailed port information with what you can do with each port
4. ✅ Ask if you want to save to a file and let you choose the location

Let me know if you encounter any other issues!
