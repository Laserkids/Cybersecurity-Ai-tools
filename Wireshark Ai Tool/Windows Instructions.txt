Perfect! I've updated it to use Ollama instead. This is completely local and free!

## Setup Instructions for Windows 11

### 1. Install Ollama
- Download Ollama from https://ollama.ai
- Run the installer
- Ollama will automatically start in the background

### 2. Pull a Model
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
```bash
# Recommended models (choose one or more):
ollama pull llama3.2        # Fast and good (2GB)
ollama pull llama3.1        # More capable (4.7GB)
ollama pull mistral         # Great alternative (4GB)
ollama pull phi3            # Smaller, faster (2.3GB)
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install scapy requests tk
```

You may also need **Npcap** for packet capture:
- Download from https://npcap.com/
- Install with default options

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python wireshark_ai_analyzer.py
```

## Key Features

✅ **100% Local** - No API keys, no internet required  
✅ **Free** - No costs whatsoever  
✅ **Private** - Your network data never leaves your machine  
✅ **Multiple Models** - Choose from llama, mistral, phi3, etc.  
✅ **Auto-detect Models** - Automatically finds installed Ollama models  
✅ **Connection Status** - Shows if Ollama is running  

## How to Use

1. Make sure Ollama is running (it usually auto-starts)
2. Load your Wireshark .pcap/.pcapng file
3. Select your preferred model from the dropdown
4. Ask questions about your network traffic!

The app will automatically detect which models you have installed in Ollama and let you switch between them.
